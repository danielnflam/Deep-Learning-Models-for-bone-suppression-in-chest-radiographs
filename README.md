# Deep Learning Models for bone suppression in chest radiographs
 Gusarev's bone suppression method, as described in https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2017.8058543
 The software here has been implemented in Python 3.6 and PyTorch.
 
 # How to run the software:
 1) Go to analysis script
 2) 
 
 # Training dataset used to generate the model:
 Training data from the JSRT Chest X-ray dataset (not included) by Shiraishi et al. (DOI: https://doi.org/10.2214/ajr.174.1.1740071) and the bone-suppressed version by Juh√°sz et al. (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-13039-7_90).  The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/hmchuong/xray-bone-shadow-supression.
 
 
 
 # Other people's software
 Pytorch-MSSSIM from https://github.com/jorge-pessoa/pytorch-msssim and was used for training, as specified in the Gusarev et al. paper.
 torchviz is from https://github.com/szagoruyko/pytorchviz/tree/master/torchviz and was used for debugging.
